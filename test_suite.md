  ðŸ“Š Test Coverage

  The test suite covers all requirements from the TODO list:

  1. âœ… Daemon functionality - Status checks and integration tests
  2. âœ… Data processing pipeline - Full OCR â†’ Vision â†’ Problem Detection â†’ Solution Generation workflow
  3. âœ… Smart database - High-frequency storage, complex queries, text extraction with positioning
  4. âœ… MCP server queryability - Natural language queries, semantic search, activity detection
  5. âœ… Real-time coding problem detection - Uses actual screenshots from test data
  6. âœ… LLM solution generation - Complete with explanations and complexity analysis

  ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Tested

  - Screenshot Analysis: Processes twosum.png, hackerrank_hard_01.png, getcracked_medium_01.png
  - Problem Detection: Identifies algorithm challenges, compilation errors, test failures
  - Solution Generation: Creates working code with explanations and complexity analysis
  - Database Operations: Stores and queries multimodal data with millisecond precision
  - Natural Language Interface: "What coding problems did I encounter?" style queries
  - Performance: Sub-5-second processing, >0.1 FPS throughput, <500MB memory usage

  The test suite is production-ready and follows the project's UNIX philosophy with clear, composable tools that provide detailed output for debugging and monitoring.
