# Savant AI: Comprehensive Release Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the path to releasing Savant AI, a sophisticated multimodal AI assistant with real-time coding assistance, across macOS, Windows, and Linux platforms. The strategy emphasizes cross-platform compatibility, containerization where appropriate, and non-technical user accessibility while maintaining the application's advanced capabilities.

**Current Status**: Fully functional on macOS with 96% coding problem detection accuracy and 850ms AI pipeline performance.

**Target Timeline**: 16-24 weeks to full cross-platform release with comprehensive distribution channels.

## 1. Project Overview

### Current Capabilities ✅

### Implementation Gaps Summary

| Feature | macOS | Windows | Linux |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| Screen Capture | ✅ Complete | ❌ Stubbed | ❌ Stubbed |
| Audio Capture | ✅ Complete | ⚠️ Partial | ⚠️ Partial |
| System Integration | ✅ Complete | ❌ Missing | ❌ Missing |
| GUI Framework | ✅ Complete | ✅ Ready | ✅ Ready |
| CLI Tools | ✅ Complete | ✅ Ready | ✅ Ready |
| Database | ✅ Complete | ✅ Ready | ✅ Ready |

## 3. Containerization Strategy

### Recommendation: **Hybrid Approach**

Traditional containerization is **not suitable** for Savant AI due to:
- **Hardware access requirements** (screen capture, audio devices)
- **Real-time performance constraints** (500ms capture intervals)
- **Desktop integration needs** (system tray, stealth mode)
- **Permission model conflicts** (macOS TCC, Windows UAC)

### Hybrid Implementation Plan

#### Containerized Services
- **LLM Inference** (`savant-llm`) - Stateless processing service
- **Database Operations** (`savant-db`) - Data management service
- **MCP Server** (`savant-mcp`) - Model Context Protocol service

#### Native Components
- **GUI Application** (Tauri) - Desktop integration required
- **Audio/Video Capture** - Hardware access required
- **OCR/Vision Processing** - Real-time performance critical
- **System Integration** - Platform-specific APIs required

#### Alternative Packaging (Recommended)
- **Flatpak** (Linux) - Sandboxed with hardware access portals
- **AppImage** (Linux) - Portable with direct hardware access
- **Snap** (Linux) - Universal packaging with interface connections
- **Native installers** - Platform-specific packages (.dmg, .msi, .deb, .rpm)
