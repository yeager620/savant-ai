**Corrected view**: 
- ACID compliance crucial for screen capture metadata integrity
- Zero-configuration deployment valuable for desktop applications
- Excellent full-text search with FTS5 purpose-built for text analysis
- WAL mode optimization shows thoughtful performance tuning
- Schema complexity justified by rich semantic analysis requirements

### JSON for IPC is Pragmatic
**Initial critique**: "Inefficient serialization for high-frequency data"
**Corrected view**:
- Schema evolution easier with JSON than binary protocols
- Debugging and logging significantly simpler
- Performance impact negligible compared to OCR/vision processing overhead
- Cross-language compatibility enables future extensions

### Comprehensive Database Schema Shows Foresight
**Initial critique**: "461-line migration file indicates over-engineering"
**Corrected view**:
- Rich semantic analysis requires complex data relationships
- Temporal queries across different data types need proper indexing
- Performance optimization through strategic index placement
- Future feature expansion without breaking schema changes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legitimate Design Concerns

### 1. Screen Monitoring Efficiency
- PNG screenshots every 500ms creates significant I/O overhead (~172,800 files/day)
- Limited compression optimization beyond basic PNG encoding
- OCR processing on every frame regardless of content stability
- No differential compression for sequential similar frames

### 2. Processing Pipeline Synchronization
- Synchronous processing blocks main capture thread
- No batching for similar ML inference tasks
- Limited worker pool utilization for CPU-intensive operations
- Missing backpressure mechanisms for processing queues

### 3. GUI Architecture Complexity
- Leptos/WASM adds unnecessary complexity for desktop taskbar application
- 995 lines of embedded CSS in Rust code creates maintenance burden
- Web-based UI limitations for native system API access
- Accessibility constraints compared to native frameworks

## üéØ High-Impact Optimization Opportunities
